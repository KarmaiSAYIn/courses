``Henry McCarty'' is the lesser known pronoun for ``Billy the Kid''
(this isn't absolutely accurate; the name he used later in the courtroom was ``William H. Bonney, jr.''; and was known as ``Ollie L. Roberts'' at some point);
as a result, I'll refer to him as the latter (or simply shortened to ``Billy'').

Billy the Kid was a famous (better depicted in the present tense?) New Mexican outlaw of whom stands among the most famous western outlaws of America's ``Wild West'' era.
His generally accepted birth-date\footnote{
    Historical context regarding Billy the Kid is ambiguous at best and downright incorrect at worst. This is where all the

is September 17 1859, in New York City; a short time later his family moved to New Mexico.
Some time during his teen years, Billy had his first run-in with the law (during 1875); a simple case of clothing theft.
His first murder happened during August 1877; where an argument with a common ``argumentee'' turned into a fist-fight which was put to an end with Billy's quickdraw.

The whole of the historical precedence of Billy the Kid's life can be summed up in his death; with his back turned to a frightened harborer who shot him twice in the back.
