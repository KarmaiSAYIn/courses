\maketitle

\subsubsection*{What surprised you about the people living in extreme poverty?}
    \begin{adjustwidth}{24pt}{0in}
        How content someone can be with almost nothing; all but family.
    \end{adjustwidth}
\subsubsection*{What do the lives of Rosa, Anthony and Chino make you think about your own life?}
    \begin{adjustwidth}{24pt}{0in}
        Certainly, I'm blessed; I have such an abundance of books that I don't even know what to do with them anymore.
        How can someone who lacks a decent education have more personality than most people?
        With this said, I can't imagine myself being a ``good person'' in these conditions; I'd likely steal my own living.
    \end{adjustwidth}
\subsubsection*{What do you think were three of the hardest things for Zach, Chris, Sean and Ryan that could have kept them from going to Guatemala?}
    \begin{adjustwidth}{24pt}{0in}
        Among the difficulties of abandoning American civilized life if favor of living in extreme poverty;
        Zach, Chris, Sean and Ryan left their college education on pause to go through with this prospect;
        the factor of their leaving their families for such a long period of time;
        the simple idea of such a challenge, they much have known it wouldn't have been easy.    
    \end{adjustwidth}
\subsubsection*{What do you think Zach, Chris, Sean and Ryan gained by living on \$1 a day themselves in this community, instead of just reading about it?}
    \begin{adjustwidth}{24pt}{0in}
        Zach, Chris, Sean and Ryan gained first hand experience living on \$9 a day (They drew up to \$9 from the hat);
        they felt the struggles of gathering food, and maintaining a property on such an income;
        because of this; they likely also learned much more on the delicacies of economics than could be portrayed by an algorithm.
    \end{adjustwidth}
\subsubsection*{What is something in your life that you now think about differently after watching this film?}
    \begin{adjustwidth}{24pt}{0in}
        The fact of my spoiling father of whom I can ask for items monumental compared to the implications of poverty;
        this film makes me reconsider the competition we're so familiar with in American culture;
        as we fight for excess, while they fight for the bottom-line.
    \end{adjustwidth}
\subsubsection*{After watching this film, why do you think that Chino, Rosa, and Anthony are still living in extreme poverty? What do you think are some of the things holding them back?}
    \begin{adjustwidth}{24pt}{0in}
        Chino, Rosa, and Anthony are likely in a better situation now; however is also likely to be still in poverty compared to how we live now.
        At the very least their lives are much better and hold a brighter future.
    \end{adjustwidth}
\subsubsection*{What other questions do you now have about poverty, micro-finance, or the lives of people around the world?}
    \begin{adjustwidth}{24pt}{0in}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item{How much of the effects we so constantly hear about are because of government influence; Not just at the affect other governments, but our own?}
        \item{What can I do to help solve this problem for everybody on this planet?}
    \end{itemize}
    \end{adjustwidth}
