\PutTitle{Freshman Fitness Period 4}

Set your own house in order before you criticize the world; an idiom that pertains well to this assignment.
Part of one's own house is one's own mind; in fact they're one in the same.
Having a dirty, wretched smelling home, with last weeks laundry sprawled across the floors shows only the degree to which you take care of your mind; and with the taking care of your mind you coincidentally take care of your body; again, one in the same.
To me, this is precisely what taking care of myself means, it's quite as simple as physical exertions that happen to clear your environment.
