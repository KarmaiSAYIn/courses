\section*{Drive}
\paragraph~
Discipline is a sought-after trait; rewarding, enabling; and it leads to \textit{power}.
\textit{Power} is all that matters; \textit{power is} my drive.
This isn't to say I have an agenda, I refer to \textit{power} as the feeling; with the feeling comes the genuine presence of \textit{power}.
\textit{Power} creates \textit{flow}, \textit{flow} is the passing of time, the feeling of exhilaration with a task, a task which is difficult to the perfect degree; without being rigorous.
The feeling of \textit{flow} makes you unstoppable, it gives you \textit{power}.  
Given \textit{power}, you have discipline, motivation, you have \textit{drive}.

\section*{Purpose}
\paragraph~
\textit{Drive} is a synonym for \textit{purpose}; not necessarily because it has a similar definition, but because \textit{drive} inspires \textit{purpose}; to be driven implies a purpose for being driven.
My purpose, my \textit{drive}, is the notion of creation; all-seeing or not, I want to create, no \textit{need}.
Over the course of my early childhood (allow me to be honest, I'm still a child), I had many outlets to express this need; first it was making structures in 
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft}{Minecraft}, then making basic edits with the
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Suite}{Adobe Suite}, finally graduating to 3D modeling; the two latter's, in one way or another, lead to \textit{programming}.
Programming is quite literally the holy grail of creativity, it incorporates building, editing, and modeling all at once! Who knows what I'll make, but it'll definitely make \textit{something}.

\section*{Freedom and Options}
\paragraph~
``Freedom'' and ``Options'' are really buzzwords, more so ``freedom'' than ``options,'' what I imagine, however, when hearing these words is this; exactly what makes me happy; options are more daunting than peaceable;
    having options doesn't mean you're going anywhere, it means you're drowning in all the places that are possible to you.
