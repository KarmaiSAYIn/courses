\section*{Five things that struck me about the movie
{\color{blue}\underline{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfcq5pF8u8}
{``13''}}}\footnote{I believe the film is actually called ``13th.''}:}
\begin{enumerate} \item{The United States makes up 5\% of the population of the
planet, but it also makes up 25\% of the planet's prisoner population.}
\item{The concept of {\color{blue}\underline{\href{
https://www.cjpf.org/mandatory-minimums}{``mandatory sentencing''}}} essentially
where a judge's ability to do their job in the proper way is removed.}
\item{While viewing, I was realizing that black people have never truly had
freedom in this country (even still).}

\item{Donald Trump's proposal to force the death penalty upon a group of
innocent African American children.}

\item{The supposed removal of the parole system.}

\end{enumerate}
