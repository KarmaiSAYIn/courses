According to the document ``3700 YEAR OLD GEOMETRY'' ancient Babylonians used
    the Pythagorean triples to establish land boundaries, and was an important
    endeavor as it allowed them to have boundaries that could be agreed upon;
    the article cites a source that explains that proper boundaries allowed
    the Babylonians to have healthier relationships as well.
The Pythagorean triples are $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, and relate the properties of a
    triangle with a $90^{\circ}$ angle, where $c$ is the length of the
    hypotenuse.

The establishment of land boundaries used the Pythagorean triples, which implies
    a far more involved role that mathematics played in the development of
    modern society as one of the requirement of a functional society is the
    definition of individual property, to quote the article; 
    ```This is from a period where land is starting to become private - people
    started thinking about land in terms of ``my land and your land,'' wanting
    to establish a proper boundary to have positive neighborly relationships,'
    {\color{blue}\underline{\href{
    https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/923620} {he explained}}}.'' 

Established land boundaries made social life more plausible, according to the
    article, land boundaries settled a dispute regarding date palms between the
    border of two properties where a land surveyor was involved.

Geometry, and mathematics in general, is essential to a functioning society;
    from its place in engineering to its role in land boundaries, we see
    mathematics everywhere.
During the Babylonian times the Pythagorean triples were used to settle land
    boundaries, in other words it was the earliest example we have of property
    being a device in society; also this use forces us to reinterpret the length
    of time that humans have made use of math.
