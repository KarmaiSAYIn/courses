\section*{Part A: All About Me}

I was born on November 2, 2005 at Taos Holy Cross Hospital.
I had managed to wrap my neck in the umbilical cord such that I had to be removed from my mom's stomach by c-section.
Part of my conceptualization involved a custody battle between my mother and father.
This custody battle forced my father to sell a 1968 Chevrolet Camaro Super Sport in order to pay for his lawyer, I would be driving it around today had he not sold it.
Long story short, my father won custody over me and I have lived out the first fifteen years of my life in a large house next to the {\color{blue}\underline{\href{https://www.taoscountryclub.com/}{Taos Country Club}}} with him.

I bear crawled before I crawled and, according to my father, ran before I walked.
It was in the courtroom where my parents allowed their lawyers to fight for the right of raising me, it was the first time I'd seen my father in months <more precise?>; I heard his voice in the court room and ran down the hallway to him as soon as I was out of my moms hold, I was three years old. <fact check this>
