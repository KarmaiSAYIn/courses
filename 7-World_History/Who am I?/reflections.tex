\section*{What did this project teach you about yourself?}

This project gave me an opportunity to reflect on my life events in a manner
that would allow somebody unfamiliar with them to gain an understanding.

\section*{What does this project have to do with World History?}

World history is essentially all of human history, besides a few occurrences of
which were out of this world, and my life is part of human history even though
it isn't well known to the degree of what one would normally deem ``World
History.''

\section*{What was your favorite part of this project – and why?}

My favorite part of this project was part A; I didn't do part B, so my answer
might have been different had I done it.

\section*{What was the most challenging part of this project – and why?}

The most challenging part of this assignment was organizing all of my past
events in a cohesive manner, and coping with their significance.
