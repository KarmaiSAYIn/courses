Regarding the luck involved with the accident of Phineas Gage; my monition would be that
he was blessed from the cosmos. The text states: (page 6 pagaraph 1) ``Amazingly, Phineas
is still alive. The iron throws him flat on his back, but as his men come running 
through the gunpowder smoke, he sits up. A minute later, he speaks." The test also states
"... the iron missed his jawbone, lightly clipped the interior orach of his brow, and 
knocked out one molar but didn't destroy the socket. Of the remaining seven routs, two 
would have cut important blood vessels that would have killed Phineas instantly." These
peices of evidence from the text support my delegation because of their prominence in
describing the specific nature of the path the tamping iron took through Phineas' skull.
