Role Model
by Jonah Mondragon
April 16, 2021
The person I would regard as my role model is Jocko Willink; he was a Navy SEAL officer and now
spends his time running a podcast discussing discipline and running a high level gym. His audio books
“Psychological Warefare” and “Discipline Equals Freedom Field Manual” represent the turning point of my
life from an angsty, lazy, disrespectful punk that I was to now; while still flawed, I wake up every day at
4:20am, brush my teeth and meditate for around ten minutes, until 4:35am; I then read from the Bible, or
some sacred text (what’s the point in practicing one religion?) until 5:00am; from 5:00 to 6:00am I excercise
one specific part of my body (whichever is lacking compared to others); I then come back later at 5:00pm
to complete a full body workout, or a specific day from a workout program, whichever I’m in the mood
for. I spend the great majority of my free time reading productive books from the standpoint of computer
programming and mathematics.
