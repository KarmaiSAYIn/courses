The person I would regard as my role model is \href{https://jockopodcast.com/about/}{Jocko Willink}; he was a Navy SEAL officer
and now spends his time running a podcast discussing discipline and running a high level gym. His audio books
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS18QVQqApQ&list=PLqb3Ua5zACVJZAJ3W4zGCbkzW1mKfmKG2&index=1}{``Psychological Warefare''} 
and 
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLyBTEJQVbQ&list=PLJTFXZw7PaPSAvZKjONcEJuIeQuLWcndh&index=1}{``Discipline Equals Freedom 
Field Manual''}
represent the turning point of my life from an angsty, lazy, disrespectful punk that I was to now; humble, proactive (while maybe
lacking a little on my schoolwork), and respectful; while still flawed, I wake
up every day at 4:20am, brush my teeth and meditate for around ten minutes, until 4:35am; I then read from the Bible, or some
sacred text (what's the point in practicing one religion?) until 5:00am; from 5:00am to 6:00am I exercise one specific part of my
body (whichever is lacking compared to others); I then come back later at 5:00pm to complete a full body workout, or a specific
day from a workout program, whichever I'm in the mood for. I spend the great majority of my free time reading productive books
from the standpoint of computer programming and mathematics. Jocko's words hold such a level of power, it's really hard to not get
influenced by what he's saying; I have his 
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS18QVQqApQ&list=PLqb3Ua5zACVJZAJ3W4zGCbkzW1mKfmKG2&index=1}{``Wake up and Get After It''}
recording as my wake-up alarm. There's also a man Jocko has worked with known as 
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjQC-0H574c}{Akira The Don}
who has remixed most of Jocko's
recordings into quite good songs that are insanely motivational. 
Despite all of this, I still lack the simple discipline to complete my (honestly) very easy schoolwork.
This assignment is the start of an extensive all-nighter, maybe spanning a few days, in order to complete it all.
